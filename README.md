YouTube mirror (sort of)

This is an old app I wrote in 2007. It used the YouTube api of it's time, which I believe has bee deprecated.

The app would allow you to browse different categories and tags and watch YouTube videos using their player.

When this app was live, Google indexed over 300,000 pages of my site. I threw some Google ads on there a made a couple hundred bucks.

It was a fun little project at the time.
